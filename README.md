## FCC-Nightlife-App
##### Build a Nightlife Coordination App project [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app)
##### Check it out [here](https://fcc-nightlife.glitch.me/)

<br/>
<br/>

##### Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://yasser-nightlife-app.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.
######  Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.
###### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

- User Story: As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
- User Story: As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
- User Story: As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.

##### Hint: Try using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/) to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
